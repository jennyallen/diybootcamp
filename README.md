#MamaHomeSchool


There are a variety of video courses freely available from organizations such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org), the [Open Courseware Consortium](http://www.oeconsortium.org), and [iTunes U](http://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/). Sure you planned to learn quantum physics over spring break and to take a survey course in Victorian literature during your summer vacay, but you lack willpower. **MamaHomeSchool will motivate you.** Say bye to slacking and get cracking. We will take your goals and schedule time for course watching, homework completion, and review with peers. For those of you who also want to challenge yourself physically, Mama will incorporate workouts between reading and linear algebra problem sets. She will also harass (motivate) you with reminders to studyâ€”sent to you and friends, relatives, or disciplinarians.

We will start by offering users a selection of the 42 [Open Yale Courses](http://oyc.yale.edu). The user picks what he or she wants to learn and how long he or she has to learn it, and completes a survey that will help determine work ethic (and thus feasibility of completing number of courses). The application will schedule a certain number of course hours each day, homework assignments, and examinations. Users will submit homework to an assigned DropBox where they can compare with others taking the course. The application will aslo assign a workout each day, likely drawn from CrossFit Workouts of the Day.

At a fundamental level this will be a scheduling application. The output will be an iCal that users can incorporate into Google Calendar.
